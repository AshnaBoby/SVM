# SVM
This project predicts heart disease using SVM. It preprocesses data, trains the SVM classifier, evaluates its accuracy, predicts disease for a sample input, and visualizes data relationships using Seaborn.

This project applies Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict heart disease based on patient attributes. The dataset comprises features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more. Preprocessing involves encoding categorical variables using LabelEncoder and ensuring data integrity by checking for missing values.

After preprocessing, the dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the SVM classifier's performance. Utilizing a linear kernel, the SVM model is trained on the training data and achieves promising accuracy on the testing set, indicating its effectiveness in heart disease prediction.

An example prediction is demonstrated using sample patient attributes, showcasing the model's capability to assess heart disease risk. This functionality provides medical professionals with valuable insights for risk assessment and patient management, potentially leading to early intervention and improved outcomes.

Furthermore, a pairplot visualization is generated to explore the relationships between different features concerning the presence or absence of heart disease. This visualization aids in identifying potential patterns or correlations that may influence prediction outcomes, offering additional interpretability to the model's predictions.

Overall, this project serves as a crucial tool for healthcare professionals in early detection and prevention of heart disease. By leveraging SVM and insightful visualizations, this predictive model contributes to enhancing patient care, ultimately promoting better health outcomes and quality of life.
